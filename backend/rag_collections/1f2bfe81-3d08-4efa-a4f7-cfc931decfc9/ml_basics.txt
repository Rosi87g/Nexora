Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms 
that can learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Deep learning is a specialized type of machine learning that uses neural networks 
with multiple layers to process complex patterns in data.

Common applications of machine learning include:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing and text analysis
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
