Her face, pale and tired, changed when she saw me. \nSomething softened in her eyes. My father stood nearby, unsure where to place his \nhands, trying to understand that the sound filling the room now belonged to him. \nThat day, many children were born in the same hospital.

She counted quietly, then looked \nat me again. There was no celebration in her expression—only care mixed with \nworry. She lifted me into her arms while my mother slept and held me close, as if \nthe world outside the room had already begun asking too much. \nI slept through the day. \nI did not know I was being watched. \nMy grandmother sat without moving for hours. She listened to my breathing, \ntouched my forehead from time to time, and stayed awake through the night. My \nmother remained asleep for two days, her body heavy from what it had endured. \nDuring that time, my grandmother never left me alone. \nWhen my mother finally opened her eyes, she searched the room before she found \nme. She smiled, slowly, as if the effort itself mattered. \n“So small,” she said. “So calm.” \nMy father lifts me carefully.

He held me longer than needed, saying nothing, as \nthough words might disturb the moment. \nSome people came to see me. Some did not. \nMy father’s mother never came. No one spoke about it. Silence had already learned \nhow to live in that house. \nA few days later, we returned home. \nMy father walked ahead. My mother followed, carrying me, moving with great care. \nShe smiled, but that smile had already learned endurance. During her pregnancy, \nshe had worked without pause—cooking, cleaning, walking between houses, \ncarrying burdens that ignored her condition. No one asked her to stop. \nMy father was often away. He left early. He returned late. Questions remained \nunasked.

Questions remained \nunasked. My mother carried both the weight of the house and the child within it, \nquietly. \n\nI knew none of this. \nI knew hands, warmth, voices, and light. I laughed without reason. I cried without \nunderstanding. \nMy grandmother stayed close. Always close. She trusted my sleep more than \nconversation and watched over me as if vigilance itself was an act of love. \nToys appeared—small, bright objects placed near me with care. I reached for them \nwithout interest. Faces mattered more than things. \n*Every son born is a hero for his family, carrying the hope of protection and \nstrength. \n*Every daughter born is a pride for her family, carrying the grace of love and \nhonour. \nIn truth, every birth is a blessing, a new chapter written by destiny. \nThe beginnings of life are always filled with expectations—before a chil", "[Source: Before I Knew the World.pdf] [Uploaded file: Before I Knew the World.pdf] a blessing, a new chapter written by destiny. \nThe beginnings of life are always filled with expectations—before a child even \nlearns to stand on their own legs, the family already dreams of the paths they \nwill walk. \nThe child is unaware of these expectations. \nThe child does not choose them. \nIn those first days, I was untouched by judgment or hope. I did not know who \nstayed and who did not. I did not realise the effort, sacrifice, or absence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMy first birthday arrived before I could understand what it meant. \nThe house is filled with people. Faces leaned close. Voices rose, overlapped, \nlaughed. Everyone seemed to know me, though I knew none of them.

The noise unsettled \nme. The crowd felt heavy. Comfort existed only in what I already knew. \nI stayed with my mother. \nAnd with my father. \nThat day brought new faces and new words. Some spoke softly. Some spoke \nloudly. Some spoke as if my life had already been assigned meaning. \nI did not understand relationships. \nI did not understand responsibility. \nBut I felt both enter the room. \nMy father was still at the beginning of his working life then. Before my mother, he \nhad moved without direction. After her arrival, something in him changed.

She watched how my father listened, how his \nattention had moved. Soon, instructions followed. Orders. Control. \nMy mother accepted them without resistance. \nShe fed me in her arms—without pain, without complaint. Only patience. Only a \nsmile that never argued back. \nMy father worked long hours. Sometimes, nearly the whole day passed before he \nreturned. His work took him from one place to another without rest. Until he \ncame home, there was no food in the house. \nWhen he returned, he brought rice wrapped in a thin cover. My mother cooked it \nquietly. We ate without ceremony. \nThat was enough. \n\nWhen my father saw me, his tired face softened.
