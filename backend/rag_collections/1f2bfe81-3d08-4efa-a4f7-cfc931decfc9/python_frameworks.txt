Python Machine Learning Frameworks

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
It is widely used for deep learning applications and neural network training.

PyTorch is another popular deep learning framework developed by Facebook.
It is known for its dynamic computation graphs and ease of use.

Scikit-learn is a traditional machine learning library that provides
simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling.

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline.
It involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for model training.

Training machine learning models requires:
1. Large datasets with quality labeled examples
2. Sufficient computational resources (CPU/GPU)
3. Proper validation and testing procedures
